# Advanced Animation React Native

This is a small project to test out the combined libraries: 

- React Native Gesture Handler
- React Native Pose
- React Native Reanimated

The application is very simple, it's a list of Cooking recipes that are displayed on the screen. However, what is special in this app is the animations and transitions between the data sets displayed.
